// To demonstrate sharing of state between our host application
// and our user scripts, we define a simple struct that holds an integer.
// As mentioned in the definition of our op below, certain types must be
// converted to be handed between Rust and JavaScript, meaning a direct
// sharing of memory is not always possible and some duplication might
// be required.

// Ops in Deno can be asynchronous or synchronous.
// By default, async ops are directly polled without awaiting them, which matches
// the behavior of async JavaScript functions but is different from normal Rust.
// Certain data types, such as the OpState or integers, can be directly passed between
// JavaScript and Rust.
// Especially strings can introduce some overhead, as JavaScript's UTF-16 strings must
// first be converted to Rust's expected string encoding UTF-8.
// More information about ops performance and type conversions can be found at:
//   https://docs.rs/deno_core/latest/deno_core/attr.op2.html

// This macro conveniently defines and implements a struct for initializing our extension.
// In other examples such as https://github.com/denoland/roll-your-own-javascript-runtime/
// you may find that the extension definition is split between a "build.rs" build script
// and runtime code.
// This is done to create a snapshot that takes care of parsing and preparing the
// extension's JavaScript code at build time to improve the program's start time.
// For this demo, we forgo this optimization.
